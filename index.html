                I am a 4th year Automation Engineering Technology student at McMaster University. I specialize in smart systems, IoT-enabled control systems, and system & process design.
                However I take alot of pride in my activities outside of school as well, I am much more than just an average student at my school as I am also a very creative, open minded,
                out of the box thinker who can do alot more than just solve equations or do assignments in a classroom. This website will give you a good insight into who I am as not only a student,
                or an engineer, but also a person.
